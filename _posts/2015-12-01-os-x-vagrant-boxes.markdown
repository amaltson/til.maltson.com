Last year while automating my OS X [workstation with Chef], I wanted to get a
Vagrant OS X machine to test the Chef recipes on. There didn't seem to be an
easy way [at the time], so I left my cookbook untested üò≠üêº.

Last week my buddy asked this very same question, are there any OS X Vagrant
boxes? As I typed the email saying there aren't any, I decided to do a quick
search on [Hashicorp's Atlas]. To my disbelief, there are actually [many OS X
Vagrant boxes] hosted on Atlas. It turns out that because of the [license
changes], running OS X virtual machines is easier than ever.
