For the last few days I've been trying to get my iMac booting again when
confronted with the [White Screen of Death]. Having exhausted the options, all
roads led to reinstall. I bit the bullet fearing I'd have to restore my data
from backups. When the install finished, I learned that OS X reinstalls only
affect the OS and leave the data intact!
