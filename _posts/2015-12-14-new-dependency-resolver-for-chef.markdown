The Chef mailing list moved to a [Discourse forum] a little while back, which
makes asking questions and having discussions a pleasure (I ðŸ’œ  Discourse).

We've been having a bunch of problems resolving `Berkshelf` and `chef-client`
dependencies, so I decided to ask a question. The helpful [martinb3 pointed me
to Berkshelf master]. It turns out, `Berkshelf` is working on a new dependency
resolution system in the [solve gem]. This new resolver is also written in pure
Ruby, which means no pesky C extensions via `gecode`.
